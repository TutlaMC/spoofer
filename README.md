# Spoofer

A Minecraft mod that lets you **spoof (fake!) your F3 menu and Mod Menu list**.
Currently, in **BETA**.

### Main Uses

* Hide your coordinates (great for SMPs)
* Hide the mod itself
* Add a touch of humour

---

## Features

### Simple/Hidden Manager

* **Keybind:** Default is `G` (configurable under the *General* tab).
* Config file: `/assets/spoof.json` (inside your Minecraft folder).

### Hide Mods

- Need privacy? Delete any mod while Minecraft is running (it’s in RAM already), then hide it from Mod Menu with Spoofer.
- Add mods to the blacklist under the *Mods* section.
- **Note:** It only hides the mod in Mod Menu. The total mod count will still show.

### F3 Menu Spoofing *(Beta)*

- Change details displayed in the F3 menu (more features coming soon).
- Current spoof options:
  - **Coordinates** – Four modes:
    - `DEFAULT` → Normal behaviour
    - `RANDOM` → Randomized values (good for screenshots, not streams)
    - `FIXED` → Stays the same, even when you move
    - `OFFSET` → Shifts your coordinates by a chosen offset (e.g., real: 25/30/73 → offset X:+7 → shows 32/30/73)
  - **FPS** – Works similarly to offset coordinates.
- Works only for the F3 menu. 
- ⚠️ Expected conflicts with *BetterF3*.

Do you want me to also **make it more "GitHub README-ready"** (with emojis, badges, installation instructions, etc.), or keep it plain-text like this?
